# Recommended to only edit vault_sizes at the start of a server/wipe/fresh plugin installation.
# If you make vaults 5 rows, DO NOT change this value to a lower one at a later date, or player items maybe lost/data load will fail.
# You CAN safely increase this value at anytime, even if players have items in those vaults.
# A row is 9 slots. So 3 rows is a single chest, 6 is a double chest. You can choose any value from 1-6.
